THEORY:-
The Reader–Writer Problem is a classic synchronization problem in operating systems.
•	There are multiple reader threads and writer threads.
•	Readers can read the shared data simultaneously if no writer is writing.
•	Writers must have exclusive access — only one can write at a time, and no reader can read during that.
The goal is to avoid race conditions and ensure mutual exclusion using semaphores.

Algorithm:
1. Initialize:
•	mutex = 1 → controls access to readCount.
•	wrt = 1 → controls access to shared resource.
•	readCount = 0 → number of active readers.

2. Reader Process:
•	wait(mutex)
•	readCount++
•	if (readCount == 1)
•	wait(wrt)
•	signal(mutex)
•	wait(mutex)
•	readCount--
•	if (readCount == 0)
•	signal(wrt) 
•	signal(mutex)

3. Writer Process:
•	wait(wrt)
•	signal(wrt)
