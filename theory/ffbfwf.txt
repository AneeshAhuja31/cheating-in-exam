THEORY:-
1. First Fit Algorithm
Definition:
In the First Fit algorithm, the operating system allocates the first available memory block that is large enough to accommodate the process. The search for a free block begins from the start of memory and stops as soon as a suitable hole is found.
Working Principle:
1.	Maintain a list of free memory blocks (holes).
2.	Traverse the list from the beginning.
3.	Allocate the first block that is large enough for the process.
4.	If the block is larger than required, the remaining portion is left as a smaller free block.
Advantages:
• Fast and simple to implement.
• Minimal search time for allocation.
Disadvantages:
• Leads to external fragmentation over time.
• The beginning of memory gets filled quickly, leaving small unusable holes.
Applications:
• Suitable for general-purpose systems where speed of allocation is more important than memory efficiency.
2. Best Fit Algorithm
Definition:
The Best Fit algorithm allocates the smallest free block that is large enough to satisfy the process’s memory request. The goal is to minimize wasted space within allocated blocks.
Working Principle:
1.	Search the entire list of free memory blocks.
2.	Select the block that gives the least leftover space after allocation.
3.	If multiple blocks fit equally well, the first among them is chosen.
4.	Split the block if it is larger than required.
Advantages:
• Reduces internal fragmentation by using space efficiently.
• Attempts to leave larger holes for future allocations.
Disadvantages:
• Slower allocation time due to searching the entire list.
• Can create many small unusable holes, increasing external fragmentation.
Applications:
• Used when memory utilization efficiency is more important than speed, such as in batch or embedded systems.
3. Worst Fit Algorithm
Definition:
The Worst Fit algorithm allocates the largest available free block to the requesting process. The idea is to leave the largest remaining hole, hoping it can accommodate future processes.
Working Principle:
1.	Search the entire list of free blocks.
2.	Select the block with the maximum size.
3.	Allocate memory to the process and leave the remaining part as a smaller hole.
Advantages:
• Reduces the chance of creating very small fragments initially.
• May perform better in systems with variable process sizes.
Disadvantages:
• Wastes large memory spaces for small processes.
• Requires searching the entire list, increasing allocation time.
• Still prone to external fragmentation in the long run.
Applications:
• Used in systems where large processes frequently arrive and fragmentation control is desired.
