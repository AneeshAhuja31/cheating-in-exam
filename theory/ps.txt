NON-PREEMPTIVE MODE:-
THEORY:-
Priority Scheduling is a CPU scheduling algorithm in which each process is assigned a priority. The CPU is allocated to the process with the highest priority (typically the lowest numerical value, unless otherwise specified).
In Non-Preemptive Priority Scheduling, once the CPU is assigned to a process, it cannot be taken away until the process finishes execution.
Key Concepts
•	Arrival Time (AT): Time at which the process arrives in the ready queue.
•	Burst Time (BT): Time required by a process to complete execution.
•	Priority (P): Importance of a process. Lower value indicates higher priority.
•	Completion Time (CT): Time at which the process completes execution.
•	Turnaround Time (TAT): TAT = CT - AT
•	Waiting Time (WT): WT = TAT - BT
Characteristics
•	Non-Preemptive: Once a process starts, it runs till completion.
•	Starvation: Low-priority processes may wait indefinitely.
•	Aging: Technique to gradually increase priority of waiting processes to prevent starvation

PREEMPTIVE MODE:-
THEORY:-
In Preemptive Priority Scheduling, the CPU can be taken away from a running process if a new process arrives with a higher priority (lower priority number, usually) than the currently running one.
This means that the scheduler continuously checks for any process with a higher priority and preempts the currently running process if necessary.
Key Points:-
•	CPU can be interrupted: A running process may be paused to allow a higher priority process to run.
•	Context switching happens frequently, depending on process arrival and priorities.
•	Prevents long waiting times for high priority processes.
•	Can cause starvation for low priority processes.
•	Response time becomes important: time from arrival to the first time the process gets the CPU.
Key Concepts:-
•	Arrival Time (AT): Time at which the process arrives in the ready queue.
•	Burst Time (BT): Time required by a process to complete execution.
•	Priority (P): Importance of a process. Lower value indicates higher priority.
•	Completion Time (CT): Time at which the process completes execution.
•	Turnaround Time (TAT): TAT = CT - AT
•	Waiting Time (WT): WT = TAT - BT
•	Response Time (RT): Time from process arrival until the first time it starts execution.
