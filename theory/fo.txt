THEORY:-
In an operating system, a file directory is a data structure that stores information about files — such as their names, locations, types, and access permissions. A directory provides:
•	A mapping between a file name and its physical location on disk.
•	A way to organize files for efficient storage, retrieval, and management.

Different operating systems use different directory structures depending on complexity, user requirements, and access patterns.

Types of Directory Organization Techniques

1. Single-Level Directory

Definition:
•	In this method, all files are stored in the same directory.
•	Every file in the system has a unique name, and there is no hierarchy or subdirectory.

Working:
•	All users share the same directory space.
•	Files are identified by their unique names.
•	Access is direct using the file name.

Advantages:
•	Very simple to implement and understand.
•	Easy to maintain for small systems.

Disadvantages:
•	Name conflict: Two users cannot have files with the same name.
•	No grouping: Difficult to organize files logically.
•	Poor scalability: Becomes confusing as the number of files increases.

Applications:
•	Early operating systems (like MS-DOS).
•	Small embedded or single-user systems.

2. Two-Level Directory

Definition:
•	In this structure, each user has their own directory, and all user directories are contained within a master directory.
•	This avoids name conflicts and allows better file organization.

Working:
•	Each user’s files are kept separate in their personal directory.
•	File names can repeat across different users.
•	The OS searches the user’s directory when accessing files.

Advantages:
•	Eliminates naming conflicts between users.
•	Provides a basic level of security — users cannot directly access others’ files.
•	Allows user-specific file organization.

Disadvantages:
•	Users cannot easily share files with each other.
•	Still limited hierarchy — only two levels.
•	Becomes inefficient for systems with many users.

Applications:
•	Multi-user systems like UNIX (in early versions).
•	University or company systems with distinct user accounts.

3. Tree-Structured Directory

Definition:
•	The tree-structured directory is a hierarchical organization where directories can contain subdirectories, allowing an arbitrary depth of file organization.
•	This is the most common and flexible structure used in modern operating systems.

Working:
•	Files are accessed using pathnames:
•	Absolute Path: /user/alice/report.docx
•	Relative Path: ../bob/notes.txt
•	The root directory is at the top of the hierarchy.
•	Each directory may contain both files and subdirectories.

Advantages:
•	Allows grouping and logical organization of files.
•	Supports user directories, shared folders, and system files.
•	Provides efficient access control and file management.
•	Highly scalable for large systems.

Disadvantages:
•	Slightly more complex implementation.
•	Requires additional memory to maintain directory hierarchy.
•	File path traversal can be slower if the directory tree is very deep.

Applications:
•	Modern operating systems (Windows, Linux, macOS).
•	Cloud file systems and large-scale servers.
