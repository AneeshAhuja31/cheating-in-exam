THEORY:-
Banker’s Algorithm is used to avoid deadlock by checking if resource allocation to a process will leave the system in a safe state. It is named because a banker never allocates all his cash to customers without ensuring that enough remains to satisfy future needs.

Key Concepts:
Each process must declare in advance:
•	Max – the maximum resources it may need.
•	Allocation – resources currently allocated.
•	Need = Max – Allocation.
•	Available – resources currently available.
Before granting a request, the system checks whether it would still be in a safe state.

Algorithm:
Step 1: Initialization
•	Input total number of processes n and resource types m.
•	Input Available, Max, and Allocation matrices.
•	Compute Need = Max – Allocation.

Step 2: Safety Algorithm
1.	Work = Available
Finish[i] = false for all i
2.	Find a process i such that:
o	Finish[i] == false
o	Need[i] ≤ Work
3.	If such a process is found:
o	Work = Work + Allocation[i]
o	Finish[i] = true
o	Add i to safe sequence
4.	If no such process exists and some Finish[i] = false → system is unsafe.
Else → safe sequence found
