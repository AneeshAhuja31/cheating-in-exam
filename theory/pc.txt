THEORY:-
Producer–Consumer Problem is a synchronization problem. A producer generates items and places them in a buffer, while a consumer removes them. To avoid race conditions: 
•	Use a mutex (binary semaphore) for mutual exclusion.
•	Use empty semaphore to track free slots. 
•	Use full semaphore to track filled slots.

Algorithm:
Initialize: 
•	mutex = 1, empty = N, full = 0. 

Producer: 
•	Wait on empty. 
•	Wait on mutex. 
•	Add item to buffer. 
•	Signal mutex.
•	Signal full. 
Consumer: 
•	Wait on full. 
•	Wait on mutex. 
•	Remove item from buffer. 
•	Signal mutex. 
•	Signal empty.
